AirQualityMonitoring
This Java REST API aims to monitor air quality at a local scale using crowd sourced sensors. It intends to locate sources of localized pollution. It collects hourly pollutant data from a simulated air quality monitoring sensors owned by the public. By following EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) calculations, it checks for the presence of sufficient data and computes the AQI for each pollutant at each sensor location and determines the max hourly and daily AQI. The result can be shown on a bubble map colored by the AQI category. Technologies Used:

Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA-Hibernate, Spring Security
